        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education encompasses the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.  </p></div>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">As we enter a new era of technology and innovation, it is imperative that we transform the way education is delivered to our students.

By embracing new technologies, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, we can create dynamic and immersive learning experiences. Additionally, we must prioritize social and emotional learning, equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate an increasingly interconnected world. By revolutionizing our approach to education, we can empower students to think critically, collaborate effectively, and adapt to a rapidly changing landscape. </p></div>
